Credit Card Fraud Detection and Analysis

Overview:

This project develops a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using historical transaction data. It analyzes transaction patterns and classifies them as fraudulent or not.

Problem:

With the increasing volume of digital payments, fraud detection has become more challenging. Fraudsters exploit vulnerabilities, and machine learning can help by identifying anomalous behaviors and transactions to reduce risks.

Approach:

Dataset: 1,000,000 rows, 7 independent features, and 1 dependent feature (fraud label).
Modeling: Implemented 5 machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, and SVM.
Data Poisoning Attack: Applied a data poisoning attack on the SVM classifier, reducing its accuracy from 95% to 94.33%.

Results:

Highest accuracy: 99.999% achieved with the Random Forest model.
The model can help users predict whether their transactions are fraudulent.
